# Introduction

# Data
- exclude actors and directos. Too many categories. We capture the predictive power by including cast facebook likes.
- exlcude `gross_2015 budget, gross, budgeT_2015` because of missings
- Select movies only budget 2015 at least 1m
- prediction should only rely on factors observed before screening, so we also cannot use the post screening variables: imdb_score, gross, user_reviews critic_reviews.
- use measures corrected for inflation (\_2015) for budget and gross
- use length of title
- genres are not mutually exclusive, so keep dummy for each genre as it is in the original dataset.
- exclude missing budget
- exlude further 7 observations with missing MPAA rating
