# Introduction
Is it possible to before its screening predict whether a movie will be a blockbuster? Movie producers face the issue of how to optimally plan a movies market rollout, as well as assess the prospects of their future outcome.


# Data
- exclude actors and directos. Too many categories. We capture the predictive power by including cast facebook likes.
- exlcude `gross_2015 budget, gross, budgeT_2015` because of missings
- create outcome variable: TRUE/FALSE if  gross_2015 is 3*budget_2015, then remove gross_2015 
- Select movies only budget 2015 at least 1m
- prediction should only rely on factors observed before screening, so we also cannot use the post screening variables: imdb_score, gross, user_reviews critic_reviews.
- use measures corrected for inflation (\_2015) for budget and gross
- use length of title
- genres are not mutually exclusive, so keep dummy for each genre as it is in the original dataset.
- drop year bc not very informative for prediction
- fb likes director and actors some 0 values - prob not having (included in package results- package can handle?)
- mpa rating - some unrated, "not rated", passed, some "X" - we don't know meaning - (included in package results - package can handle?) - for now not ordered for package bc of missing info about these var - set mtry to no of predictors so all variables are considered, 
- unbalanced data - very roughly around 1/5 of obs manage to reach gross goal 
- more movies with low budget than high budget

# Method
In order to assess the financial success of a proposed movie we adopt a classification tree and bagging approach respectively.

- run package Â´rpart':
  - cp = 0.004 as in slides

- run package "randomForest":
- plot of out of bag error and number of bags/trees ---> tradeoff computations and error - we choose XXX no of trees for low error and fast computation




# Results



# Conclusion

discussion
- observations used are already selected - already produced - 

future research:
- balanced outcome set / predict successful movies


# Code
```{r ref.label=knitr::all_labels(), echo = T, eval = F}
```
